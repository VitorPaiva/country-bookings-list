# React Country List Component

This project is a React Component. A list of countries and their bookings for the year.

## Testing the Component

Clone the repo into your local machine and navigate to it. 
Open the terminal in the project folder and run:

### `npm start`

# Notes:
It was not possible to query the endpoint to getch de country data due to CORS policy.  
For that reason the fetch is still in the code but in case it fails it will load the data previously given.
